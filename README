= magic_meta_methods
  
== Instructions

A plugin to generate many methods or "attributes" on ActiveRecord that
persists data into a serialized text based column as defined by :column. This
plugin is particularly useful for storing display data or meta data that isn't intended to be queried
directly via SQL. It reduces the number of "one-off" columns and the clutter of serialized declarations
with getter/setters on your model.

== Installation

  ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/techwhizbang/magic_meta_methods.git

== Usage

=== Prepare database

Add this migration to the desired table(s):

  class MagicMetaMethods < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      add_column :your_table_here, :magic_meta_methods, :mediumtext
    end

    def self.down
      remove_column :your_table_here, :magic_meta_methods
    end
  end

  rake db:migrate

=== Meta Magic Methods in action

Let's suppose your model needs to store a variety of data and types, but
these values don't need to be queried on, many times these values are purely
for display or front end purposes.

  class YourModel < ActiveRecord::Base
    magic_meta_methods([:abstract,
                       [:some_hash, :hash],
                       [:some_array, :array],
                       [:some_indifferent_hash, :indifferent_hash]], :column => 'alternate_meta')
  end
  
We can now use the magic meta methods just like a regular attribute setter

  m = YourModel.new
  m.abstract= "This is a brief synopsis of magic meta methods"
  m.some_hash = {:a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3}
  m.some_array = [["Monday", "9-5"], ["Tuesday", "9-5"], ["Wed", "Closed"]]
  m.some_indifferent_hash = {:dog => "Fido", :cat => "Garfield"}
  m.save
  
You can retrieve the values

  m.some_indifferent_hash['dog'] #Fido
  m.abstract #This is a brief synopsis of magic meta methods
  m.some_array[0] #["Monday", "9-5"]
